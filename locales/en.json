A low, stable ping is great, but high jitter means your connection is unstable, causing unpredictable spikes in latency.",

    "jitterExplainedWhyText": "High jitter is a major cause of lag in online games, choppy audio in VoIP calls (like WhatsApp or Zoom), and buffering during video streams. For real-time activities, a stable connection (low jitter) is often more important than raw speed.",
